    <h2>Hello, my name is Jason John </h2>
    <p>I am a computer science major and I just turned a sophomore, I love to learn about coding and how computers work.</p>
    <p>I was a track runner back in high school and grew up playing a lot of sports like soccer, basketball and football, I would always prefer outdoor games as it makes you move more and it also makes you spend a good quality time with your friends and family.</p>
    <h2>Favourite sports</h2>
